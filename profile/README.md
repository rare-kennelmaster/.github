</div>
<h2>Purpose of KennelMaster</h2>
<p>KennelMaster is designed to help manage a boarding kennel or cattery business under Windows. It consolidates essential data - client records, pet data, bookings and payments - into a single interface. The program aims to simplify operations for kennel owners and staff by automating booking processes, tracking occupancy, and providing business-management tools.</p>

<h2>Main Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Automated reservation system for an unlimited number of kennel units.</li>
  <li>Client and pet records management: store detailed information about pet owners and animals, including past bookings and history.</li>
  <li>Charge and payment tracking through the entire booking cycle, with support for local currency.</li>
  <li>Daily task coordination for care needs of each animal - helps staff keep track of feeding, cleaning, special needs, etc.</li>
  <li>Graphical and statistical reporting tools to monitor business performance and generate insights.</li>
  <li>Support for kennel or cattery operations including boarding, reservation management, and business bookkeeping.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>KennelMaster is aimed at small to medium-size boarding kennels, catteries, pet boarding facilities, and pet care businesses that need a desktop solution on Windows to manage bookings, clients, pets, payments and day-to-day operations.</p>

<h2>Advantages</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Combines multiple necessary functionalities (booking, client/pet records, payments, reporting) in a single software - reduces need for multiple tools or spreadsheets. </li>
  <li>Windows-based - works on common desktop systems without need for cloud or web access.</li>
  <li>Potentially suitable for small-to-mid kennels needing a simple on-premise management solution rather than cloud subscription services. </li>
  <li>Offers a unified database of clients, pets, bookings and financials which simplifies record-keeping. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Functional Modules</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Booking / Reservation System - manage kennel unit occupancy and schedule future bookings.</li>
  <li>Client & Pet Database - store owner info, pet profiles, history of stays and care instructions.</n><li>Payments & Billing - record charges, payments, generate invoices, track payments for bookings.</li>
  <li>Task / Care Scheduling - plan daily care tasks for boarded pets (feeding, cleaning, special needs).</li>
  <li>Reporting & Statistics - generate business performance reports (occupancy, revenue, client history).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Supported Platforms & System Requirements</h2>
<p>KennelMaster runs on Microsoft Windows - versions referenced include Windows XP, Vista, 7 and also reportedly Windows 10.</p>
<p>The program appears to be a desktop/shareware solution rather than a web/cloud platform.</p>

<h2>Licensing & Availability</h2>
<p>KennelMaster is distributed as a trial/shareware version, with version 3.0 being cited in sources.</p>
<p>The vendor (listed as Copper Software Ltd) positions KennelMaster as an affordable solution with "first class customer service."</p>

<h2>Limitations and Reliability Concerns</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Information about active maintenance, recent updates, or vendor's current support status is very limited. The latest known release is 2013 (version 3.0) per one source.</li>
  <li>Given the age, compatibility with the latest Windows versions (Windows 10 / 11) may be uncertain - no clear recent changelog or update notes found. </li>
  <li>No evidence of modern features that competing kennel-management solutions now offer (e.g. cloud sync, mobile access, online booking, vaccination reminders, integrated payments). </li>
</ul>

<h2>Use Cases & Typical Scenarios</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Small boarding kennels or catteries needing to manage pet stays, owner data, and reservations without relying on online/cloud software. </li>
  <li>Owners preferring a simple desktop-based system for client/pet records, bookings and billing. </li>
  <li>Facilities that do not require web-based booking or remote staff - just an internal tool to track occupancy, payments, and pet care logistics. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Recommendation and Notes</h2>
<p>While KennelMaster offers a basic and unified solution for kennel/cattery management, the lack of recent updates and minimal online presence suggest it may be outdated. Before depending on KennelMaster, kennel owners should test compatibility with their current Windows system and consider whether modern features - like cloud backup, mobile access, vaccination tracking, online bookings - are required for their operations.</p>
